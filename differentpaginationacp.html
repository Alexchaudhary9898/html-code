    <h1>Paragraph about cats</h1>
<p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It
is
the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but
also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill
vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>

Cats can also be kept as household pets
