                The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic
                dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by
                hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
                Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
                individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[4]

                    <p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
                    attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have identical skeletal structures (with the
                    exception of the tail and skull), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing
                    and sight. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and
                    the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Communication in dogs include eye gaze, facial
                    expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents,
                    pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new
                    environment. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a
                    topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
